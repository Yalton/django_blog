* Website accessible at http://rabbitholes.billbert.co/

* This site acts as a structured guide to help redirect your thoughts and goals to other places on the web... through the use of rabbitholes! 

* Have you ever gotten online to check a recipe for the dinner you wanted to make, only to find yourself still sitting there 3 hours later watching a gag reel for Friends? Yeah, that's a rabbithole.
A rabbithole is a research path one goes down that spirals the initial web search into something completely different. Let's feed that web surfing hunger... and maybe try to contain it a little. 

* Look, going down internet rabbitholes is natural, and hard to avoid. However, we believe that we can facilitate them by providing you with sources that are different enough from your initial search to keep your brain firing on something new, but similar enough to add to your overall learning of your initial search. 

* Start by making a free account. The first thing you'll notice is that this snooze fest of an intro will be gone... hooray!
Next, feel free to browse our different rabbitholes in the "catalog" section.
You can select any rabbithole you like to read about it, interact with its popularity, and follow it to elsewhere on the web!
Lastly, if you think you've got a great idea for a rabbithole we should add, take a stroll over to your profile to add one! While there, you can also view all rabbitholes you've saved for later viewing! 

* There are two of us making this site. We are a senior and a sophomore attending Chico State University, and we are making this site as our final project to our intro to web development class. However, we'd love to see where the site can go in the future!
